                             Setter is a graphic design project for a potential rock-climbing / bouldering mobile application. The design was crafted with rock climbers in mind through user interviews and research. The application is meant to save bouldering routes to try again or share with others.

                             <br>
                             This project was developed in a Human Computer Interactions class using the User-Centered and Task centered design processes. I hope to fully develop a working application and testing the software on U of C students at the bouldering wall.

                             This project is a work in progress and will be continued throughout 2020.
